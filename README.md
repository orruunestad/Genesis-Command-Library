### Booting the library
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orruunestad/Genesis-Command-Library/refs/heads/main/source.lua")()
```
> This loads the necessary code to create commands!

### Setting the prefix
```
local Prefix = "!"
```
> This sets the prefix for commands in chat, so for example if the prefix was !, the command would be !explode
